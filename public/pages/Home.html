    What is <b>s16</b>?
</div>

<div>
    <b>s16</b> is a system written in <b>JavaScript</b> that mimics an old computer
    system. It doesn&#39;t try to emulate any existing architecture or operating
    system, it simulates a fictional 16-bit system which is designed specifically
    to have a simple and retro feel - all will become clearer when <b>s16</b>is
    fully functional and I can move on to <b>phase 2</b><br /><br />

    The goal is to build a programmable platform that will provide the foundations for a
    future project - for now, a <b>demo</b> of s16 will exist here on this site, anyone
    interested may interact with s16, browse the code, maybe even offer suggestions or
    improvements.<br /><br />

    Hover over the nagivation bar to the left of the page and it should automatically
    expand, there you will find a link to the <b>Terminal</b>, this is where you can
    interact with the s16 system.<br /><br />

    You will also find a link to some <b>Documentation</b> that will explain how the
    system works on a more technical level.
