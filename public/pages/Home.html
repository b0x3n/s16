    What is <b>s16</b>?
</div>

<div>
    Put simply, <b>s16</b> is <b>phase 1</b> of a larger project, but it is still
    a fairly complex and extensive project all on its own which is why I&#39;ve
    decided to document it here.<br /><br />

    <b>s16</b> is a system written in <b>JavaScript</b> that mimics an old computer
    system. It doesn&#39;t try to emulate any existing architecture or operating
    system, but instead simulates a fictional <b>16-bit system</b> which is designed specifically
    to be relatively simple and have a retro look and feel - all will become clearer when <b>s16</b> is
    fully functional and I can move on to <b>phase 2</b><br /><br />

    The goal is to build a <i>programmable platform</i> that will provide the foundations for a
    future project - for now, a <b>demo</b> of s16 will exist here on this site, anyone
    interested may freely interact with s16, browse the code, maybe even offer suggestions or
    improvements!<br /><br />

    You will find links to my

        Github
    </p>
    as well as my
    <p id="inline_link_substack" class="inline_link" onclick="window.location.href = 'https://substack.com/@b0x3n'">
        Substack
    </p>
    on the <b>header</b> section of this site.<br /><br />

    Hover over the nagivation bar to the left of the page and it should automatically
    expand, there you will find a link to the
    <p id="inline_link_terminal" class="inline_link">
        Terminal
    </p>
    , this is where you can interact with the s16 system.<br /><br />

    You will also find a link to some 
    <p id="inline_link_documentation" class="inline_link">
        Documentation
    </p>
    that will explain how the system works on a more <i>technical</i> level.<br /><br />

    <b>Have fun!</b>
