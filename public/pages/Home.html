    What is <b>s16</b>?
</div>

<div>
    Put simply, <b>s16</b> is <b>phase 1</b> of a larger project, but it is still
    a fairly complex and extensive project all on its own which is why I&#39;ve
    decided to document it here.<br /><br />

    <b>s16</b> is a system written in <b>JavaScript</b> that mimics an old computer
    system. It doesn&#39;t try to emulate any existing architecture or operating
    system, but instead simulates a fictional <b>16-bit system</b> which is designed specifically
    to be relatively simple and have a retro feel - all will become clearer when <b>s16</b> is
    fully functional and I can move on to <b>phase 2</b><br /><br />

    The goal is to build a <i>programmable platform</i> that will provide the foundations for a
    future project - for now, a <b>demo</b> of s16 will exist here on this site, anyone
    interested may freely interact with s16, browse the code, maybe even offer suggestions or
    improvements!<br /><br />

    You will find links to my <div id="link_github" class="link">Github</div> as well as my <b>Substack</b> on the <b>
    header</b> section of this site.<br /><br />

    Hover over the nagivation bar to the left of the page and it should automatically
    expand, there you will find a link to the <b>Terminal</b>, this is where you can
    interact with the s16 system.<br /><br />

    You will also find a link to some <b>Documentation</b> that will explain how the
    system works on a more technical level.<br /><br />

    <b>Have fun!</b>
