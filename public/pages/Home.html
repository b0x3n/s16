    What is <b>s16</b>?
</div>

<div>
    <b>s16</b> is a system written in <b>JavaScript</b> that mimics an old computer
    system.<br /><br />

    The goal is to build a programmable platform that will provide the foundations for a
    future project - for now, a <b>demo</b> of s16 will exist here on this site.<br /><br />

    Hover over the nagivation bar to the left of the page and it should automatically
    expand, there you will find a link to the <b>Terminal</b>, this is where you can
    interact with the s16 system.<br /><br />

    You will also find a link to some <b>Documentation</b> that will explain how the
    system works on a more technical level.
